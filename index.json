You must include all components and materials and their estimated costs (even if you obtained them for free somehow). Please note where something was obtained for free and cost is just your best estimate.\nA detailed description of electrical design (circuit diagrams are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.\nA detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.\nA detailed description of the firmware design with links to complete source code (github or other repository is helpful).\nA detailed description of software design with links to complete source code (github or other repository is helpful). Please be sure to include a list of all external software dependencies (eg. OpenCV, Google Voice API, etc.)\nPhotos or videos of your final system in action.\nOur total cost for our final display was $221.27.
