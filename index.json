The first plan for team FerroFish was to use PCB magnets. However, upon testing the PCB magnets we found that they were not viable for lifting and moving ferrofluid so the decision was made to create our own electromagnets.\nElectromagnets are created by wrapping wire around a ferrous core and applying a voltage to the wire, creating a current in the wire. The current induces a magnetic field and thus magnetizes the ferrous core - creating a magnet.\nThe equation for the strength of the field given by our electromagnets is below:\n$B = \\frac{\\mu_oNI}{l}$\nWhere $\\mu_o$ is the permittivity of free space, $N$ is the number of turns in the wire, $I$ is the current, and $l$ is the length of the solenoid.\nElectromagnets are more flexible than permanent magnets because they can be easily turned on and off by adjusting voltage. As a team we decided that electromagnets would provide the flexibility.\nCreating our Electromagnets We decided for cost purposes we would create our own electromagnets rather than buying premade ones.
