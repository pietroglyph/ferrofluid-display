Tank Our tank is comprised of two sheets of 10&amp;quot; by 12&amp;quot; glass with thickness 3/32&amp;quot; separated by a 1/4&amp;quot; acrylic rim. They are attached with epoxy.
Next, the tank was cleaned thoroughly using ammonia and hot water and scrubbed with ??.
Magnets The first plan for team FerroFish was to use PCB magnets. However, upon testing the PCB magnets we found that they were not viable for lifting and moving ferrofluid so the decision was made to create our own electromagnets.</description></item></channel></rss>
