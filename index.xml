At the end of each sprint, we presented our progress to the teaching team and our peers.
Contents: Sprint One Sprint Two Sprint Three Sprint One &amp;uarr; Sprint One had three main objectives:
Create a test tank Research magnets Ordering important materials and other important organizing tasks Test Tank Creating the test tank had two subgoals: creating an &amp;ldquo;etch-a-sketch&amp;rdquo; where we were able to move metal shavings with an electromagnet and creating a water-tight tank.</description></item><item><title>Systems</title><link>https://pietroglyph.github.io/ferrofluid-display/systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pietroglyph.github.io/ferrofluid-display/systems/</guid><description>Contents: Tank Magnets Controller Firmware Animation and Software Budget Our system is comprised of mechanical, electrical, firmware, and software subsystems (click on diagram to enlarge image):
Tank &amp;uarr; Our tank is comprised of two sheets of 10&amp;quot; by 12&amp;quot; glass with thickness 3/32&amp;quot; separated by a 1/4&amp;quot; acrylic rim. They are attached with epoxy.
Next, the tank was cleaned thoroughly using ammonia and hot water and scrubbed with Goof Off.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://pietroglyph.github.io/ferrofluid-display/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pietroglyph.github.io/ferrofluid-display/about/</guid><description>[[params.gallery.gallery_item ]] image = &amp;ldquo;images/banner.jpg&amp;rdquo;</description></item></channel></rss>
