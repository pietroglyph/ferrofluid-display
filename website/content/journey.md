Requirements

Your final project site is required to contain the following elements.

A high level summary description of the projectâ€™s objectives

A system diagram depicting the schematic relationships between all of the different subsystems comprising your final system.

An account of how you spent your $250 budget. You must include all components and materials and their estimated costs (even if you obtained them for free somehow). Please note where something was obtained for free and cost is just your best estimate.

A detailed description of electrical design (circuit diagrams are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.

A detailed description of your mechanical design (CAD images/renderings are appropriate) and any necessary analysis.

A detailed description of the firmware design with links to complete source code (github or other repository is helpful).

A detailed description of software design with links to complete source code (github or other repository is helpful). Please be sure to include a list of all external software dependencies (eg. OpenCV, Google Voice API, etc.)

Photos or videos of your final system in action.
